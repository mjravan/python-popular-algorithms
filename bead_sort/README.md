# Bead Sort Algorithm
Bead Sort or Gravity sort is a species of sorting
numbers with an average of good _Big O Notation_.

# Big O Notation Of Algorithm
## Time Complexity:
The algorithm’s run–time complexity ranges from
O(1) to O(S) (S is the sum of the input integers)
depending on the user’s perspective.
Finally, three possible implementations are suggested.

1. O(S)
2. O(n^1^/^2)
3. O(n)
4. O(S)
