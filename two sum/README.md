# Two Sum Algorithm
Getting a list and desired number, then finds two number of list
that their sum equals to desired number.<br>

Two Sum
    ([2, 7, 11, 15], 22) => [2,4] # index number of two sum

# Big O Notation Of Algorithm
The algorithm’s run–time complexity is O(n^2)

# Instruction Of Algorithm
After receiving input, starts by summing first and last index
numbers. Then compare it with desired number and continually
change low, high and mid. Once that find two number, 
return back their index in a list.
