# Collection of popular Algorithms
There's a brief list of popular and usage Algorithms that I
have written them 

1. [a1z26 Cipher Algorithm](./a1z26_cipher/README.md)
    - This
2. [Bead Sort](./bead%20sort/README.md)
3. [Binary Search](./bead%20sort/README.md)
    - Binary insertion sort is a sorting algorithm which is similar to the insertion sort, but instead of using linear search to find the location where an element should be inserted, we use binary search. Thus, we reduce the comparative value of inserting a single element from O (N) to O (log N).
4. [Caesar Cipher Algorithm](./caesar%20cipher/README.md)
5. [First Occurrence](./first%20occurrence/README.md)
6. [Is Isomorphic](./is%20isomorphic/README.md)
7. [Limit](./limit/README.md)
8. [Move Zeros](./move%20zeros/README.md)
9. [Rotate](./rotate/README.MD)
10. [Search Insert](./search%20insert/README.md)
11. [Top One](./top%201/README.md)
12. [Two Sum](./two%20sum/README.md)
