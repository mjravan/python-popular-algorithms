# Collection of popular Algorithms
There's a brief list of popular and usage Algorithms that I
have written them.<br>
All Algorithms has been tested by using Unittest.

1. [A1Z26 Cipher Algorithm](./a1z26_cipher/README.md)
    - A1Z26 is very simple direct substitution cypher, where each alphabet letter is replaced by its number in the alphabet.
Below is the A1Z26 encoder/decoder. Here all letters are set to lowercase, the English alphabet is used, and all non-alphabet symbols are not transformed. In decoding, all numbers (from 1 to 26) should be separated by any non-digit symbol (dash, space).
2. [Bead Sort](./bead_sort/README.md)
   - Also known as Gravity sort, this algorithm was inspired by natural phenomena and was designed keeping in mind objects(or beads) falling under the influence of gravity. The Idea: Positive numbers are represented by a set of beads like those on an abacus.
3. [Binary Search](./binary%20search/README.md)
    - Binary insertion sort is a sorting algorithm which is similar to the insertion sort, but instead of using linear search to find the location where an element should be inserted, we use binary search. Thus, we reduce the comparative value of inserting a single element from O (N) to O (log N).
4. [Caesar Cipher Algorithm](./caesar%20cipher/README.md)
   - The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was
used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies.
It works by shifting the letters in the plaintext message by
a certain number of positions, known as the “shift” or “key”.
5. [First Occurrence](./first%20occurrence/README.md)
   - Many times we require to find the first occurring non-zero number to begin the processing with. This has mostly used case in Machine Learning domain in which we require to process data excluding None or 0 values. 
6. [Is Isomorphic](./is%20isomorphic/README.md)
   - Two strings are said to be isomorphic if it is possible to map every character of the first string to every character of the second string. Basically, in isomorphic strings, there is a one-to-one mapping between every character of the first string to every character of the second string.
7. [Move Zeros](./move%20zeros/README.md)
   - Given an array of random numbers, Push all the zero’s of a given array to the end of the array. For example, if the given arrays is {1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0}, it should be changed to {1, 9, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}.
8. [Rotate](./rotate/README.MD)
   - Given an array of integers arr[] of size N and an integer, the task is to rotate the array elements to the left by d positions.
9. [Search Insert](./search%20insert/README.md)
   - Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
10. [Two Sum](./two%20sum/README.md)
    - The naive approach uses a nested loop to check if there are 2 numbers in the list that can add up to the target. In addition, it ensures the same element is not used twice.
