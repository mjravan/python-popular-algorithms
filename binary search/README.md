# Binary Search Algorithm
One of the most famous algorithms that every programmer 
heard about it. Has a simple function and very useful!

# Big O Notation Of Algorithm
The algorithm’s run–time complexity usually is O(log n)

# Instruction Of Algorithm
First, in binary search input data need to be in
sorted order. Then after receiving order list and target
number, a function find the middle of list and compare
it with target. with every operation length of list will
be halved until find the target(guess) number
